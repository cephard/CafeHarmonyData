<h2>Dataset Used </h2>
- <a href="https://github.com/cephard/CafeHarmonyData/blob/main/Cafe_Harmony_Capstone_Project.xlsx">Datset</a>

<h2> Problem</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Product performance by GENDER.</li>
  <li>Customer spending profiles.</li>
  <li>Stock management inefficiencies.</li>
  <li>Employee performance gaps.</li>
  <li>Revenue produced from locations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Pareto Principle</h2>
Also known as the 80/20 rule analysis, to identify and focus on the following items
<li>The most significant contributing product for the majority of sales​</li>
<li>Menu items that are performing best across different locations. ​</li>
<li>Customers who have a profile that tends to spend the most(age, gender, or preferred product).​</li>
<li>How can the café improve its stock management to avoid running out of popular items while also reducing overstock?​</li>
<li>Location or employee performance issues that require attention</li>

With this approach, we aim to identify the top 20% of stock, employees, and customers that contribute to 80% of Café Harmony’s revenue. By focusing on this critical segment, we can extract key insights from the data and use them to generate intelligent business recommendations.
<br>
While we still consider the overall trends in the data, we pay particular attention to the consistent outliers that can disproportionately influence revenue performance. Although the 20/80 ratio is not a fixed rule, our goal is to highlight the minority of data points that drive value and minimize the impact of the majority that may contribute to losses.

<h2>Data Cleaning Techniques</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Use of conditional formatting to detect duplicates and removing duplicate IDS</li>
  <li>Removing blanks in the data to ensure there are no inconsistencies in the data</li>
  <li>Changing data into the correct formats from General to Number or Date</li>  
  <li>Sorting data in alphabetical order in terms of the table’s unique IDS.</li>  
  <li>Categorising data for better representation such as age(Youth, Adult, etc) or location into urban and rural</li>
  <li>Use of advanced formular such as IFS, XLOOKUP and VLOOKUP to categorise data</li>
</ol>
