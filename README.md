## ‚ùì Problem Statement  
The caf√© faced several challenges:  
- Product performance by **gender**.  
- Customer **spending profiles**.  
- **Stock management** inefficiencies.  
- **Employee performance** gaps.  
- **Revenue variations** across locations.

## üîé Methodology ‚Äì Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)  
We applied the **Pareto Principle** to identify and focus on the key factors driving most of the revenue:  
- Top-selling products contributing most to sales.  
- Menu items performing best across different locations.  
- Customer demographics that spend the most (age, gender, preferences).  
- Stock management improvements to balance supply & demand.  
- Location and employee performance issues requiring attention.  

This approach highlights the **minority (20%) of data points that drive the majority (80%) of results**.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Techniques  
1. Removed duplicate IDs using conditional formatting.  
2. Filled and corrected missing values.  
3. Standardized formats (Numbers, Dates).  
4. Sorted and organized data by unique IDs.  
5. Categorized attributes (e.g., age groups: *Youth, Adult, Senior*; location: *Urban, Rural*).  
6. Applied formulas such as `IFS`, `XLOOKUP`, and `VLOOKUP` for categorization.
