<h2>Dataset Used </h2>
- <a href="https://github.com/cephard/CafeHarmonyData/blob/main/Cafe_Harmony_Capstone_Project.xlsx">Datset</a>

<h2> Problem</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Product performance by GENDER.</li>
  <li>Customer spending profiles.</li>
  <li>Stock management inefficiencies.</li>
  <li>Employee performance gaps.</li>
  <li>Revenue produced from locations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Pareto Principle</h2>
Also known as the 80/20 rule analysis, to identify and focus on the following items
<li>The most significant contributing product for the majority of sales​</li>
<li>Menu items that are performing best across different locations. ​</li>
<li>Customers who have a profile that tends to spend the most(age, gender, or preferred product).​</li>
<li>How can the café improve its stock management to avoid running out of popular items while also reducing overstock?​</li>
<li>Location or employee performance issues that require attention</li>

With this approach, we aim to identify the top 20% of stock, employees, and customers that contribute to 80% of Café Harmony’s revenue. By focusing on this critical segment, we can extract key insights from the data and use them to generate intelligent business recommendations.
<br>
While we still consider the overall trends in the data, we pay particular attention to the consistent outliers that can disproportionately influence revenue performance. Although the 20/80 ratio is not a fixed rule, our goal is to highlight the minority of data points that drive value and minimize the impact of the majority that may contribute to losses.

<h2>Data Cleaning Techniques</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Use of conditional formatting to detect duplicates and removing duplicate IDS</li>
  <li>Removing blanks in the data to ensure there are no inconsistencies in the data</li>
  <li>Changing data into the correct formats from General to Number or Date</li>  
  <li>Sorting data in alphabetical order in terms of the table’s unique IDS.</li>  
  <li>Categorising data for better representation such as age(Youth, Adult, etc) or location into urban and rural</li>
  <li>Use of advanced formular such as IFS, XLOOKUP and VLOOKUP to categorise data</li>
</ol>

• Table A (left) indicates that the average performance targets for the top 5 employees are less than half of their achievement, suggesting that expectations should be raised.
• Table B (right) highlights the employees who are underperforming, not meeting the bare minimum.

## Business Recommendations
# 1. Optimize Menu & Inventory
Focus on demand
Instead of focusing on the amount of inventory
in numbers, the café should consider stock in
terms of demographic demand and supply.

Double Down on Top Sellers:
Expand muffin flavors/options in Urban
locations (airports, Uptown).
Promote Iced Tea combos in
Suburbs/Downtown via signage or discounts.

Reduce Sandwich Waste: Test smaller batches or revamp recipes to
boost appeal of Sandwich and Croissant

# 2. Targeted Marketing

# 3. Improve Stock Efficiency
Adjust Orders:
Reduce coffee bean, sandwich bread and sugar
purchases and reallocate budget to milk,
croissant dough, Iced tea bags, and muffins mix.
Use Juice Concentrate’s "0 margin" model as a
benchmark for other items inventory.


Tech Solution:
Developed and implemented dynamic inventory
tracking with real-time low-stock alerts to ensure
product availability.
Integrated a Point of Sale (POS) management
system for accurate tracking of both sales and
inventory.
Configured weekly automated stock alerts to
enable timely replenishment and reduce
stockouts.


# 4. Employee Performance
RAISE TARGETS: Set higher but
achievable goals for top performers

TRAINING/SUPPORT: Address
underperformers with coaching or role
adjustments

# 5. Location-Specific Strategies

Suburban/Downtown:
Highlight Iced Tea as a
"local favorite" in rural
marketing.

Urban Focus: Capitalize
on muffin/Capuchino
demand with grab-andgo options.
